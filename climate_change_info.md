The web content provides detailed information relevant to the query "Explain climate change science, evidence, impacts, and potential solutions". Here's a breakdown:

**1. Scientific Consensus**

*   The content focuses on the scientific consensus regarding climate change.
*   It emphasizes that scientists focus on evidence, not opinions.
*   It states that scientific evidence shows human activities (primarily burning fossil fuels) have warmed Earth's surface and oceans, impacting the climate.
*   It mentions that NASA provides information about climate change and highlights its role in understanding the planet. It cites peer-reviewed studies to illustrate the accuracy and consensus of research results.
*   It presents multiple studies published in peer-reviewed scientific journals showing that climate-warming trends over the past century are very likely due to human activities.
*   It notes that most leading scientific organizations worldwide have endorsed this position.

**2. Organizations Endorsing the Consensus**

*   The content provides a list of scientific organizations that support the consensus on climate change.
*   It includes links to their public statements and related resources.
*   It categorizes these organizations into:
    *   American Scientific Societies:
        *   Statement on Climate Change from 18 Scientific Associations (2009)
        *   American Association for the Advancement of Science (2014)

    *   Intergovernmental Bodies:
        *   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)

**3. Key Points & Statements**

*   **Temperature Data:** The content mentions that 2023 was the warmest year on record since 1880, with the 10 most recent years being the hottest.
*   **Human Activities:** It identifies human activities, specifically the burning of fossil fuels, as the primary driver of climate change.
*   **Scientific Method:** The text explains that the scientific method is based on an objective framework where facts or observations are explained by a hypothesis that can then be tested and retested until it is refuted.

**4. References**

*   The content includes a list of references, including scientific papers and reports.
*   The references provide citations for the information presented, including DOIs (Digital Object Identifiers) for some of the scientific papers.

**5. Additional Resources**

*   Links to other resources, such as a list of worldwide scientific organizations that hold the position that climate change has been caused by human action and information on what federal agencies are doing to adapt to climate change, are provided.

**In summary:** This web content directly addresses the query by providing a detailed explanation of the scientific consensus on climate change. It presents evidence, identifies the causes (human activities), and lists various organizations that support the consensus. It also includes references to support the information.

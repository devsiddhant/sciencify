The web content is relevant and provides information about dark matter and dark energy.

**Dark Matter:**

*   **Concept:** Invisible dark matter makes up most of the universe, detectable only through its gravitational effects. It provides the extra gravity needed to keep galaxies intact.
*   **Properties:** Unlike normal matter, it doesn't interact with the electromagnetic force, meaning it doesn't absorb, reflect, or emit light, making it difficult to detect.
*   **Composition:** Makes up about 27% of the universe, out weighing visible matter roughly six to one.
*   **Hypotheses:** Could contain "supersymmetric particles" and may exist in a "Hidden Valley", a parallel world.
*   **Research:** Experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) may provide more clues about dark matter, searching for missing energy and momentum after collisions, suggesting the presence of dark matter particles.

**Dark Energy:**

*   **Composition:** Makes up approximately 68% of the universe.
*   **Properties:** Appears to be associated with the vacuum in space.
*   **Distribution:** Distributed evenly throughout the universe, not only in space but also in time, its effect is not diluted as the universe expands.
*   **Effect:** It has a global effect on the universe as a whole, leading to a repulsive force that accelerates the expansion of the universe.
*   **Measurement:** The rate of expansion and its acceleration can be measured by observations based on the Hubble law.

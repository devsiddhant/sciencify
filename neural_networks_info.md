The provided web content from `builtin.com` indicates that the user is being asked to verify they are human and is currently waiting for a response. It also suggests that JavaScript and cookies need to be enabled to continue.

Since the content is a verification step and not the actual information about neural networks, their key concepts, applications, and recent developments, I cannot extract any relevant data. The page is likely a gatekeeper, and the actual content will only be available after successful verification.

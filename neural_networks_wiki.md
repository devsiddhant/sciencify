Here's a breakdown of the information found in the provided content, extracted and organized as requested:

*   **Definition:** A neural network is a group of interconnected units (neurons) that send signals to one another. Neurons can be biological cells or mathematical models. While individual neurons are simple, many of them together in a network can perform complex tasks.
*   **Types of Neural Networks:**
    *   *Biological Neural Network:* A physical structure found in brains and complex nervous systems – a population of nerve cells connected by synapses.
    *   *Artificial Neural Network:* A mathematical model used to approximate nonlinear functions. Used to solve artificial intelligence problems.
*   **Biological Neural Networks (in biology):**
    *   A population of biological neurons chemically connected to each other by synapses.
    *   A given neuron can be connected to hundreds of thousands of synapses.
    *   Each neuron sends and receives electrochemical signals called action potentials to its connected neighbors.
    *   A neuron can serve an excitatory role, amplifying and propagating signals it receives, or an inhibitory role, suppressing signals instead.
    *   Populations of interconnected neurons that are smaller than neural networks are called neural circuits. Very large interconnected networks are called large-scale brain networks, and many of these together form brains and nervous systems.
    *   Signals generated by neural networks in the brain eventually travel through the nervous system and across neuromuscular junctions to muscle cells, where they cause contraction and thereby motion.
*   **Artificial Neural Networks (in Machine Learning):**
    *   An artificial mathematical model used to approximate nonlinear functions.
    *   Originally physical machines, today they are almost always implemented in software.
    *   Neurons are usually arranged into layers: input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer.
    *   The "signal" input to each neuron is a number, specifically a linear combination of the outputs of the connected neurons in the previous layer.
    *   The signal each neuron outputs is calculated from this number, according to its activation function.
    *   The behavior of the network depends on the weights (strengths) of the connections between neurons.
    *   A network is trained by modifying these weights through empirical risk minimization or backpropagation to fit a preexisting dataset.
    *   *Deep Neural Network:* Neural networks that have more than three layers, typically including at least two hidden layers in addition to the input and output layers.
    *   Applications: Predictive modeling, adaptive control, facial recognition, handwriting recognition, general game playing, and generative AI.
*   **History:**
    *   The theoretical base for contemporary neural networks was independently proposed by Alexander Bain (1873) and William James (1890).
    *   Donald Hebb described Hebbian learning (1949).
    *   Artificial neural networks were originally used to model biological neural networks starting in the 1930s.
    *   The perceptron, a simple artificial neural network, was invented by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts (1943).
    *   Implementation of perceptron in hardware by Frank Rosenblatt (1957).
*   **References:** The article provides several references, including journal articles, books, and academic publications. Examples include:

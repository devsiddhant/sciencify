**Detailed Information Extraction**

*   **What is Quantum Computing?**

    *   An emergent field of computer science that harnesses the unique qualities of quantum mechanics to solve problems beyond the ability of even the most powerful classical computers.
    *   It utilizes quantum bits, or qubits, to encode more data at once than classical bits.
    *   Quantum computers can potentially process massively complicated problems at orders of magnitude faster than modern machines.
    *   Challenges that might take a classical computer thousands of years to complete might be reduced to a matter of minutes for a quantum computer.

*   **Key Principles of Quantum Mechanics (relevant to quantum computing):**

    *   **Superposition:** A quantum particle or system can represent a combination of multiple possibilities simultaneously.
    *   **Entanglement:** Multiple quantum particles become correlated more strongly than regular probability allows.
    *   **Decoherence:** Quantum particles and systems can decay, collapse, or change, converting into single states measurable by classical physics.
    *   **Interference:** Entangled quantum states can interact and produce more and less likely probabilities.

*   **Qubits:**

    *   Unlike classical computers that use bits (0 or 1), quantum computers use qubits.
    *   A qubit can be 0, 1, or a combination of both simultaneously (superposition).
    *   Qubits in superposition can scale exponentially (2 qubits = 4 pieces of information, 3 qubits = 8, 4 qubits = 16).
    *   Each qubit outputs a single bit of information at the end of the computation.
    *   Quantum algorithms store and manipulate information in ways inaccessible to classical computers.

*   **Types of Qubits:**

    *   Superconducting qubits
    *   Trapped ion qubits
    *   Quantum dots
    *   Photons
    *   Neutral atoms

*   **Classical vs. Quantum Computing Comparison:**

    | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
    | Storage            | Bits (0 or 1)                               | Qubits (0, 1, or superposition of 0 and 1)                    |
    | Data Processing    | Sequential                                  | Quantum logic at parallel instances, relying on interference |
    | Machines Used      | Common multipurpose computers and devices | Specialized quantum mechanics-based quantum hardware        |

*   **When is Quantum Computing Superior?**

    *   When encountering very complex problems (problems with lots of variables interacting in complicated ways).
    *   Classical computers struggle to simulate molecular behavior, while quantum computers can take a new approach to solve these sorts of complex problems—creating multidimensional computational spaces or running calculations that behave much like these molecules themselves.

*   **Quantum Computing Use Cases:**

    *   Pharmaceuticals (simulating molecular behavior for drug development)
    *   Chemistry (mitigating dangerous or destructive chemical byproducts)
    *   Machine learning (speeding up some machine-learning problems)

*   **Quantum Advantage vs. Quantum Utility:**

    *   **Quantum Utility:** Quantum computation that provides reliable, accurate solutions to problems that are beyond the reach of brute force classical computing quantum-machine simulators.
    *   **Quantum Advantage:** A hypothetical quantum computer capable of outperforming all classical supercomputer methods for some problem. A quantum computer capable of achieving the quantum advantage should be able to deliver a significant, practical benefit beyond all known classical computing methods—calculating solutions in a way that is cheaper, faster or more accurate than any available classical alternatives.

*   **Quantum Benchmarks:**

    *   **Quantum Volume:** Measures the largest quantum circuit that can pass a quantum volume test.
    *   **Layer Fidelity:** Provides a way to encapsulate the entire quantum processor’s ability to run circuits while revealing information about individual qubits, gates and crosstalk.
    *   **CLOPS (Circuit Layer Operations Per Second):** A measure of how quickly processors can run quantum volume circuits in series, acting as a measure of holistic system speed incorporating quantum and classical computing.

*   **Making Quantum Computers More Useful (Challenges and Advancements):**

    1.  **Scaling quantum processors:** IBM plans to introduce a quantum system with 200 logical qubits by 2029, and 2,000 logical qubits by 2033.
    2.  **Scaling quantum hardware:** Reducing footprint, cost, and energy usage.
    3.  **Quantum error correction:** IBM announced a new error-correcting code about 10 times more efficient than prior methods in 2024.
    4.  **Quantum algorithm discovery:** Finding the best ways to solve quantum problems.
    5.  **Quantum software and middleware:** Qiskit is the preferred software stack for quantum computing.
    6.  **Quantum-centric supercomputing:** Quantum computing will work in tandem with modern and future classical supercomputing.

*   **Quantum Computing Components:**

    *   **Quantum processors:** The "brain" of the quantum computer, containing qubits.
    *   **Superconductors:** Materials operating at extremely low temperatures to minimize noise and avoid decoherence.
    *   **Control:** Systems to manipulate qubits using microwave photons.

*   **Quantum Software:**

    *   IBM introduced the first stable version of the Qiskit open source software development kit (SDK), Qiskit SDK 1.x.
    *   Qiskit is the full-stack software for quantum at IBM, extending the Qiskit SDK with middleware software and services.

    *   Quantum computing is estimated to become a USD 1.3 trillion industry by 2035. (Source: McKinsey Digital, 24 April 2023.)
